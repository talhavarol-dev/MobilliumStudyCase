# MobilliumStudyCase

<h1 align=left>Case</h1> 

I model the data I got from a movie database site and transferred it to the application with Alamofire. I created a detail page for the movies and showed the pictures by downloading them with Kingfisher. I made the auto layout of the application programmatically with Snapkit. I hope you like.


Update. 
**IMPORTANT**

Instead of using scroll view, we can use tableView with 2 sections.
1. chapters slider collection views
2. sections tableViewList

Thus, we get rid of 2 different loads.

I was going to do it using a storyboard, but I didn't have enough time, it was half done.
